🚀 Hackathon Product Spec: Relay Robot Console
(app to manage a robot companion)
One-liner
Manage your personal robot companion: name it, set its “behavior mode,” send it tasks, and review what it did through generated robot videos + AI summaries.
This frames it as robot operations + human-centered communication, not romance.

🎯 Why this can win
Judges will see:
Real robotics output (videos) ✅


AI layer that adds meaning + usability (Minimax) ✅


Clear user value (robot control + safety + learning loop) ✅


Great demo story ✅



✅ MVP Scope (ship in hackathon time)
1) Onboarding
Screen: “Create your robot”
Robot Name (text input) ✅ (people can name it)


Robot “Personality Mode” (dropdown)


Calm & supportive


Direct & efficient


Professional & polite


Safety level (toggle)


Conservative (asks before acting)


Balanced


Proactive (suggests actions)


Output: Robot profile card saved.

2) Robot Control Console
Screen: “Command Center”
Inputs:
Task / Command box (e.g., “Record a demo video of you delivering a package”)


Context box (optional): “Constraints / environment / what to avoid”


Urgency slider (low → high)


Button: Send to Robot


What happens:
App generates a Robot Instruction Pack (Minimax) → structured steps


Sends to your robotics teammate’s pipeline (even if it’s manual behind the scenes)



3) Robot Activity Feed
Screen: “Runs”
Each Run card shows:
Run title (auto)


Status: queued / processing / complete


Video preview (robot video)


AI Summary (Minimax)


“Issues detected” (Minimax flags)


Next suggested improvement



4) “Teach the Robot” Loop
After a run:
User rates: ✅ Worked / ⚠ Needs improvement / ❌ Not acceptable


User notes: “What should it do differently next time?”


Minimax turns feedback into:
“Updated instructions for next run”


“Robot behavior tuning suggestion”


This is your meaningful learning loop.

🧠 Where Minimax fits (required + high impact)
A) Instruction Pack Generator (before robot runs)
Turns user intent into structured steps.
Output JSON:
goal


steps


constraints


safety checks


success criteria


B) Video-to-Insight Summary (after run)
From the robot video metadata + short human notes (or a manual “what happened” text), generate:
run summary


what went well


what failed


safety / risk flags


next suggested run


C) Feedback → Next Plan
Turns user feedback into an improved plan.

🧠 Minimax Prompt Templates (drop-in)
1) Instruction Pack Generator
You are an AI robot operations planner.

Create a safe, clear instruction pack for a robot run.

Inputs:
Robot name: {{ROBOT_NAME}}
Mode: {{MODE}}
Safety level: {{SAFETY}}
User command: {{COMMAND}}
Context/constraints: {{CONTEXT}}
Urgency: {{URGENCY}}/100

Rules:
- Be realistic, step-by-step, and safety-first.
- Add explicit checks for hazards, people, privacy, and property.
- Do not include anything illegal or unsafe.

Return STRICT JSON:
{
  "goal": "",
  "assumptions": [],
  "steps": [{"title":"","details":"","checkpoints":[]}],
  "constraints": [],
  "safety_checks": [],
  "success_criteria": []
}

2) Run Summary (post-video)
You are an AI robot run reviewer.

Summarize the robot run and identify improvement opportunities.

Inputs:
Robot name: {{ROBOT_NAME}}
User goal: {{GOAL}}
What happened (human note or logs): {{RUN_NOTES}}
Video description (optional): {{VIDEO_DESC}}

Return STRICT JSON:
{
  "run_summary": "",
  "what_went_well": ["",""],
  "issues": ["",""],
  "risk_flags": [],
  "next_run_suggestions": ["",""]
}

3) Feedback → Improved Plan
You are an AI robot coaching assistant.

Turn feedback into a better next attempt.

Inputs:
Previous plan: {{PLAN_JSON}}
User feedback: {{FEEDBACK}}
Rating: {{RATING}}

Return STRICT JSON:
{
  "updated_plan_notes": "",
  "recommended_changes": ["",""],
  "next_instruction_pack_delta": ["",""]
}


🧱 App Architecture (hackathon simple)
Screens
Robot Setup


Command Center


Runs Feed


Run Details


Data model (minimal)
RobotProfile { name, mode, safetyLevel, createdAt }


Run { id, command, instructionPack, status, videoUrl, aiSummary, userFeedback }


Backend endpoints
POST /api/robot/create


POST /api/run/create (calls Minimax for instruction pack)


POST /api/run/complete (attach videoUrl, call Minimax summary)


POST /api/run/feedback (call Minimax improvements)


Your robotics teammate can deliver videos via:
a shared folder URL / cloud link


or a simple “upload URL” field in the Run Details screen


Even manual upload is fine for hackathon.

🎬 Demo Plan (this will SLAP)
Create robot: name it live (“Nova”, “Bolt”, “Nani”, “Atlas”)


Send command: “Navigate to the hallway and deliver an object safely.”


Open a completed run: show robot video


Show AI summary + flags + suggested next steps


Add feedback (“hesitated near doorway”) → generate improved plan


That’s a full loop: Manage → Run → Evidence → Improve.

🔥 What makes it “meaningful”
Position it as:
 A human-centered robot management console that makes robots safer, easier to instruct, and learn from — using AI to translate intent into action and action into insight.
Not “robot boyfriend.” This is a robot ops + trust product.
